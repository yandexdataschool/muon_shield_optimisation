\section{Status of the SHiP Collaboration}
\label{sec:collaboration}

The SHiP Expression of Interest was submitted to SPSC in October 2013. This was followed by the Technical Proposal submitted to the SPSC in April 2015. The SHiP Technical Proposal was successfully reviewed by the SPSC and the CERN RB up to March 2016, with a recommendation to prepare a Comprehensive Design Study report by 2019.

SHiP is currently a collaboration of 53 institutes and 4 associated institutes, in  total representing 18 countries, CERN and JINR. The formal organisation of SHiP consists of a Country Representative Board (CRB), Interim spokesperson, Technical Coordinator and Physics Coordinator, and the group of project conveners as elected and ratified by the CRB. The organisation has been adopted for the Comprehensive Design Study phase.
